[**Software Development with AI-Powered Code Editors**](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/software-development-ai-powered-code-editors?ref=refind) â€“ Telerik Blog
This article explores the fascinating transformation of AI in software development, tracing the shift from basic automated tools to intelligent assistants that understand context and generate useful code. It highlights milestones like TensorFlow, large language models such as GPT, and tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Google's Project IDX.

The most captivating part is how these tools act as collaborative partners rather than just fancy autocomplete. Copilot integrates with VS Code to suggest entire functions,and  Cursor adapts to a developer's style. Overall, it shows that coding is moving from a purely manual task to a more assisted process-making development faster and more accessible.
